# Speaker Slate

People around the world are constantly looking to build a more diverse panel of speakers for their events, but they are having difficulty in finding said people who are willing to partake in them.

The Speaker Slate was created to showcase the amazing talent we have within our organization. This platform will allow speakers to have more exposure and take part in more talks and/or other public appearances.
